*** Taks description
- Alice, Bob and Carol are holders of at least one address.
- If Alice sends ether to the contract, the contract will credit half of the amount to Bob and the other half to Carol.
- Bob and Carol can withdraw their balance anytime they like.


*** Contract specs
- Alice is the contract's owner.
- Everyone can send ether to the contract. For a sender other than Alice, sending ether means to fund the contract's account, but not being part of the split.
- If sender==Alice and value>0, half of the value is credited to Bob and half to Carol. To credit means to augment the balance of each. No further tx taking place at this moment.
- If value is odd, 1 wei is retained by the contract and the rest goes to Bob + Carol.
- If value is odd again at a later time, the retained 1 wei is refunded to Alice's donation before the split.
- Bob and Carol can withdraw their balance anytime. The tx will not take place if balance is empty.


*** Web page spec
- Display contract's balance
- Display balance of Alice, Bob, Carol
- Getting the balances is done via JS asking the local node for information, not using a contract function
- Provide field "Amount in wei" and button "Split" to send amount to contract 


*** Security
- The page (JS) knows about the addresses of Alice and the contract
- If button "Split" is hit, the coinbase will be used.
This way users will refer to their own accounts when they hit the button. This  prevents any other user from sending ether on behalf of Alice. Moreover, Alice's coinbase is the contract's owner, so nothing bad will happen when using an account other than Alice's. We just have to check.
